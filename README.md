# ✨ About Me

👋 Hey there! I’m **Yash Nayak**, a **Full-Stack Engineer** who loves blending **security, automation, and creativity** to build applications that not only work — but *work smart*.  

💻 I specialize in **Laravel**, **Livewire**, **TailwindCSS**, and **MySQL**, building everything from real-time dashboards to complex enterprise platforms. My passion lies in **turning architecture into art** — whether it’s optimizing backend performance, structuring databases that scale like magic, or automating tasks so humans don’t have to.  

🔐 With a background in **Vulnerability Assessment & Penetration Testing (VAPT)**, I care deeply about **secure coding practices** and **resilient architectures**. I’ve worked on securing web, API, and network infrastructures while ensuring performance stays top-notch — because speed means nothing without security.  

🚀 I’ve developed tools that make technology simpler and smarter — from **Chrome extensions** that manage team meetings in real-time 🧑‍💻 and secure Gmail communications ✉️, to **open-source Laravel/PHP packages** that plug Google reCAPTCHA across every request automatically.  

🧠 I also love building **automation workflows** — CI/CD deployments, n8n pipelines, and custom GitHub integrations that bring the “zero-click deployment” dream closer to reality. I’m obsessed with making systems that *do the work while I sleep*.  

🧵 On the creative side, I’ve crafted full-stack systems like:  
- **Stock Alert & Prediction Platform** – Python-powered predictions with real-time alerts and Stripe membership integration 📈  
- **Learning Management Platform** – Live sessions, role-based access, and Razorpay payment integration 🎓  
- **Enterprise Store Management System** – Scalable backend with Livewire & Algolia for lightning-fast search and large-scale data handling 🛍️  

⚡ **My development philosophy:** *“Build once, scale infinitely, and secure everything.”*  

🌱 I’m currently diving deeper into the **MERN stack**, experimenting with **AI-driven SaaS products**, and contributing to **open-source tools** that help other developers code smarter and faster.  

💬 Outside of work, you’ll find me exploring creative ways to mix **design, code, and automation**, or crafting something unusual that solves a problem people didn’t even know they had. (If it saves time or reduces clicks — I’m in!)  

🌐 In short — I build **secure, scalable, and smart digital experiences** that combine **backend power**, **frontend precision**, and **a bit of developer curiosity**.  

🚀 *Always learning. Always building. Always improving.*
